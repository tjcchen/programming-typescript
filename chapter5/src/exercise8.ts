// 5.4.3 use abstract class or interface
// interface are more general and light weight, but the abstract class
// has more functionality

// (1) Interface is used to declare object structure, including object, array,
// function, class etc. Interface does not generate js code, just persist during compile time

// (2) Abstract class can build modal for classes, and it will generate js code in dist file, namely js class.
// Abstract class can have a constructor providing a default implementation, and set modifier to properties
// and methods. All of these traits cannot be implemented in interface.
